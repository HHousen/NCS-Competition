Write-ups for various challenges from the 2021 [National Cyber Scholarship Competition](https://www.nationalcyberscholarship.org/). These CTF challenges were used for both [Cyber FastTrack](https://cyber-fasttrack.org/) and the [National Cyber Scholarship Competition](https://www.nationalcyberscholarship.org/) simultaneously.

**For this cybersecurity competition, I was named a [National Cyber Scholar with Honors](https://www.nationalcyberscholarship.org/winners-2021) and was awarded a $3,000 scholarship.** Scholar with Honors is the highest accolade available through the [NCS Competition](https://www.nationalcyberscholarship.org/high-school-scholarship-competition), and is awarded to the top 30 National Cyber Scholars.
